Installing requirements
-----------------------

Install the requirements:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up the secrets.py file with the following variables:

    api_key = "Reading"
    api_secret = "All"
    access_token = "The"
    access_token_secret = "Things"

You can get an API key and secret by logging into your Goodreads
account and browing to https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys (you can put
in bogus information, as long as you don't make lots and lots of call
the Goodreads folks don't mind). For the access token, er, I'll add
the stuff to get it later.

Using
-----

Tested with Python 3.3.
